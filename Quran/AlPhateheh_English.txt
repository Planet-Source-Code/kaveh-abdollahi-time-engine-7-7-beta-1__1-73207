1.In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate
2.Praise belongs to God, the Lord of all Being,
3.the All-merciful, the All-compassionate,
4.the Master of the Day of Doom.
5.Thee only we serve; to Thee alone we pray for succour.
6.Guide us in the straight path,
7.the path of those whom Thou hast blessed, not of those against whomThou art wrathful, nor of those who are astray.
